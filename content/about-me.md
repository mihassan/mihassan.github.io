In my quest to establish a personal corner on the internet, I embarked on the journey of creating my own website.
I'm Md Imrul Hassan, though most people simply call me Imrul.
Born and raised in the bustling megacity of Dhaka, Bangladesh, I spent the first 25 years of my life there before venturing overseas for advanced studies.
I transitioned into the software industry and have been thriving as a software engineer for the past 9 years.

## Educational Background

I began my academic career with a Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from the Islamic University of Technology (IUT), Bangladesh, in 2003.
Following this, I obtained a Postgraduate Diploma in ICT from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) in 2005, and a Master's degree in Radio Engineering from Kyung Hee University, South Korea, in 2008.
My academic journey culminated in earning a PhD from Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, in 2013, where my research centered on Wireless Networks and Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks.

## Career Path

After completing my PhD in 2013, I ventured into the world of software development in 2015, embracing the challenges and opportunities of this dynamic field.
My journey led me to Google in 2016, where I have since been part of various teams pushing the boundaries of technology and innovation.

My early work at Google was under the Next Billion Users (NBU) initiative, focusing on making technology accessible for emerging internet users.
I contributed to several impactful projects: Neighbourly, a local Q&A app; Kormo Jobs, a job matching platform; and TaskMate, a task-based incentive app.
Currently, I'm part of the Google Maps team, applying my software development skills and wireless communications expertise to enhance global mapping services, demonstrating a continuous journey of technological innovation and impact.

## Hobbies and Interests

My leisure time is often spent engaging in a variety of intellectually stimulating and creative activities.
I have a profound enthusiasm for puzzle solving and competitive programming, both of which not only serve as excellent outlets for my analytical skills but also keep me abreast of the latest technological advancements and coding techniques.
Alongside these cognitive pursuits, I am deeply passionate about the latest tech gadgets, always eager to explore how these innovations can enhance everyday life.
Music, particularly subcontinental tunes, offers me a cherished connection to my cultural roots, providing solace and joy through its melodies.
Although my active engagement in photography has waned, my past experiences in capturing moments through the lens have left me with a lasting appreciation for the art, teaching me to observe the world through various perspectives and appreciate its intricate details.

## Future Goals and Aspirations

My future goals are fueled by the drive to innovate in software development, especially within my role at Google Maps, aiming to make significant impacts on global navigation and user experience.
I'm inspired to blend my technical expertise with personal interests, such as revisiting photography and embracing lifelong learning, to maintain a fulfilling balance between professional achievements and personal growth.
Ultimately, my ambition is to contribute meaningfully to technology while continuously exploring new horizons in both my career and hobbies.
